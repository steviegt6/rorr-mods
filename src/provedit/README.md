# ProvEdit

**ProvEdit** is a level editor for [Risk of Rain](https://store.steampowered.com/app/248820/Risk_of_Rain/) by Hopoo Games.

Levels created with ProvEdit will be able to be loaded in future versions of the [Risk of Rain ModLoader](https://rainfusion.ml).

As the project is created in [GameMaker Studio 2](https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker) you must own a license to be able to view and compile the source code.

## Highlights:

* Quickly paint terrain using the autotile brush and add in details using the tile pencil.
* Experimental online editing.
