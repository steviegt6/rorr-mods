# Debug Overlay

> by tomat

---

This is a simple mod that displays the GameMaker debug overlay by running `show_debug_overlay` at the start of the game.

## Installation

This mod uses Aurie Framework and YYTK, so they should be installed.

- [Aurie installation guide](https://github.com/AurieFramework/Aurie/wiki/Installation-Guide).

For YYTK, grab the latest release from the [GitHub Actions page](https://github.com/AurieFramework/YYToolkit/actions) (you should get the x64 Release build) and add it as a mod by following the Aurie installation guide.

Once Aurie and YYTK are installed, add Debug Overlay (`DebugOverlay.dll`) as a mod the same way you did with YYTK.
