# rorr-mods

**rorr-mods** is monorepo for [my](https://tomat.dev) Risk of Rain Returns (RoRR) modding ventures.

RoRR, like Risk of Rain, was made in GameMaker. One big difference, however, is that RoRR targets YYC. For a little more information on the topic of YYC, you may refer to my [small writeup](https://gist.github.com/steviegt6/170423eb92e9e55d3aae771ecac22516) I wrote when HoloCure made the move.

There are several projects here, but most predominately the *Umbrella API* and some other related projects.

## Umbrella API

The *Umbrella API* and associated tools introduce a C# mod loader and modding API to GameMaker games, specifically tailored for RoRR.

## OpenWinExt

A completely open-sourced and reimplemented version of the auxiliary RoRRWinExt native library used in RoRR.
